<p id="introduction"></p>
<h3>Hi my name is Natalia Quezada, my pronouns are she/her!</h3>
<p>I am a dual student at SCC and a student at Year Up. I am 6 months into program and will graduate in September.</p>
<p>My goal is so enter the Cyber Security and either focus on Pentesting or PM role here. I am excited to complete internship and get started.</p>
<p>I have taken a few IT 120, 121, and a few more to start my career in Tech. </p>
<p>When i'm not stuck at my computer, I am the crazy plant lady outside of class. I have a mini forest in my living room soaking up the little sun we get. </p>
<p>Don't give out advice, if they didn't ask for it. I know it's hard to hear our friends rant but sometimes they just want to rant and not get advice.</p>
<p>I am here to advance my JS knowdlge as I enter the tech field in cyber security. </p>
<p>I am intrested in ethical hacking, but i'm new to this, so please don't hack me, lol. </p>
